Project Description :

1. At first I have loaded the topics of quiz with the given API of Programming-hero.
2. Added a button on every topic which is used for loading another API of quiz questions dynamically.
3. On the questions page, the questions have shown along with options. Whenever an option is clicked, there will be a toast showing the message either the answer is correct or wrong. A eye button is present in every question box which allows us to see the correct answer of each question.
4. Other features of the website is there is a statistics page which shows the number of questions of each topic through a line chart. Then there is a blog section with some assignment questions given by instructor.
